# songPlayer
Raspberry Pi 3 song player using python3 script

I am creating a Radio Alarm Clock, which has many features. One feature is the ability to play songs from my music library. I didn't know what features would be required for a song player, and so created this script and played with it for a while to ensure it had everything I needed.

Eventually the featues of this script will be folded into the Alarm Clock Radio's GUI.
